# Chimera Cards
### Overview
Chimera Cards aims to add extra flavour to runs by adding modifiers to cards that change how they work. Instead of seeing the same Cleave every time, you may instead find a Searing Cleave which can be upgraded any number of times, or perhaps a Bludgeoning Cleave which costs much more, but deals proportionally more damage as well!

Modifiers should work on cards from most mods, with few exceptions, though which modifiers are able to roll will change on a card by card basis. Given the large amount of modifiers available, most cards will have plenty of options they can roll.

### Features
Chimera Cards comes packaged with 100+ modifiers that are split into different rarities. By default, some modifiers are more likely to be seen than others, with rarer cards being more likely to see rarer modifiers. If you would like to know which modifiers are valid for any given card, a new button was added to the large card preview screen to view all modifiers which can be roll on the card.

In addition to modifiers, it also adds 10+ new options in vanilla events. Some of these offer additional ways to get normal modifiers on cards, while others are the only way to receive event exclusive modifiers.

Finally, a Modifier Screen was added to the main menu to let you browse modifiers to see how they work on any cards they can be applied to. Included in this screen is a Settings button you can access to quickly change all the configuration options.

### Configurable
Appealing to different play styles was a core concept when designing the mod, and as such, it comes with many config options to suit your tastes. All of the config options can be accessed from the Modifier Screen and include the following:

What percentage of cards should roll modifiers

How likely Common / Uncommon / and Rare modifiers are to appear

How much the rarity of the card should influence the modifier it rolls

Should starter cards roll modifies

Should cards in shops roll modifies

Should cards from events or relics like Pandora's Box roll modifies

Should Orb related modifiers be able to roll on other characters

Should the extra Event options appear

In addition to this, any modifiers added via other mods (such as crossover content of modifier packs), will be given their own config option as well to toggle if those modifiers should also appear.

### Compatability
Chimera Cards should play well with most other mods, though if you run into any compatability problems, please let me know!

Specific crossover support was added for the following mods:

Spire Locations - Extra rewards added can roll modifiers

The Rainbow - Rainbow cards from chests can roll modifiers

Big Cards - Massive Mod and Tiny Mod will change the size of the card

Ocean's Pencil Case / Visible Card Rewards - Reward cards will have their names changed to reflect applied modifiers

Blurry Blur - Blurry Mod will make whatever card it is applied to blurry.

There are no known compatability issues at this time.

### For Modders
If you are a modder and you would like to make additional modifiers as crossover content (or just making a new modifier pack), check out the Chimera Card's wiki to get started! Registering your mod and modifiers with Chimera Cards will automatically add a new config into the Modifier Settings page to enable/disable your content pack.
