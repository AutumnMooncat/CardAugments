# 奇美拉卡牌mod
### 简介
Chimera Cards aims to add extra flavour to runs by adding modifiers to cards that change how they work. Instead of seeing the same Cleave every time, you may instead find a Searing Cleave which can be upgraded any number of times, or perhaps a Bludgeoning Cleave which costs much more, but deals proportionally more damage as well!

Modifiers should work on cards from most mods, with few exceptions, though which modifiers are able to roll will change on a card by card basis. Given the large amount of modifiers available, most cards will have plenty of options they can roll.

### 特性概述
Chimera Cards comes packaged with 100+ modifiers that are split into different rarities. By default, some modifiers are more likely to be seen than others, with rarer cards being more likely to see rarer modifiers. If you would like to know which modifiers are valid for any given card, a new button was added to the large card preview screen to view all modifiers which can be roll on the card.

In addition to modifiers, it also adds 10+ new options in vanilla events. Some of these offer additional ways to get normal modifiers on cards, while others are the only way to receive event exclusive modifiers.

Finally, a Modifier Screen was added to the main menu to let you browse modifiers to see how they work on any cards they can be applied to. Included in this screen is a Settings button you can access to quickly change all the configuration options.

### 高度可配置化
不同的游玩风格在设计本mod之初就是主要的目标，因此本mod有很多选项任君挑选。以下选项都可以在 主界面-卡牌修改-设置 中访问:

修改卡牌的概率

普通/罕见/稀有修改出现的概率

卡牌稀有度影响修改的权重

是否允许修改初始牌

是否允许修改商店牌

是否允许修改事件和遗物获得的立即牌(例：潘多拉的魔盒)

是否允许其他角色也能获得充能球修改

是否允许出现额外的事件选项

此外，其它mod添加的修改内容（如额外的修改组）会有额外的选项来决定是否在游戏中启用。

### 兼容性
本mod应当能和其它mod一同游玩而不产生额外的兼容性问题。如果有，欢迎在steam评论区留言！

本mod为以下几个mod做了额外的兼容性修改:

Spire Locations - 额外卡牌奖励能开出修改

The Rainbow - 彩虹牌能开出修改

Big Cards - 笨重与精小词条也会影响卡牌的大小

Ocean's Pencil Case / Visible Card Rewards - 被修改的卡牌会直接反映在显示的卡牌名称上

Blurry Blur - Blurry Mod will make whatever card it is applied to blurry.

当前没有已知的兼容性问题。

### 我想添加新的词条！
If you are a modder and you would like to make additional modifiers as crossover content (or just making a new modifier pack), check out the Chimera Card's wiki to get started! Registering your mod and modifiers with Chimera Cards will automatically add a new config into the Modifier Settings page to enable/disable your content pack.
